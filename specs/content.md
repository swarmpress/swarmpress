# Additional Briefing  
## Autonomous Content Adaptation per Village & Language  
*(Editorial & Agent-Oriented Content Production Phase)*

---

## 1. Purpose of This Briefing

With the **final navigation** and **page structures** now completed, the next major phase focuses entirely on **content**.

At the moment:
- All editorial pages still contain **Riomaggiore-based content**
- All content exists **only in English**
- Other villages and languages are effectively using **placeholder content**

This phase defines how content must now be:
- **Village-specific**
- **Language-specific**
- **Agent-generated**
- **Editorially authentic**
- **Fully autonomous**

This briefing is strictly about **content creation and adaptation**, not layout, design, or navigation.

---

## 2. Non-Negotiable Constraints

### 2.1 Layout & Structure

- The **current page layouts are final**
- HTML structure, components, and visual hierarchy must **not be changed**
- Section order, headings, and content slots are fixed

The task is:
> **Replace and generate content only**

---

### 2.2 Riomaggiore Content as Editorial Template

The existing Riomaggiore English content serves as:
- A **structural template**
- A **stylistic reference**
- A **content completeness benchmark**

It must **not** be:
- Copied verbatim
- Slightly reworded for other villages
- Translated mechanically without adaptation

---

## 3. Target State

For **every village** and **every language**, the site must contain:

- Fully original, village-specific editorial content
- Language-native writing (not literal translation)
- Consistent editorial depth across villages
- Distinct tone, nuance, and emphasis per location
- Content authored by **autonomous agents** with defined personas

---

## 4. Villages & Languages Scope

### 4.1 Villages

Content must be generated individually for:
- Riomaggiore
- Manarola
- Corniglia
- Vernazza
- Monterosso al Mare

Each village is treated as:
- A distinct editorial entity
- With its own character, rhythm, and priorities

---

### 4.2 Languages

For each village, all pages must exist in:
- English
- Italian
- German
- French

Each language version must:
- Read as **native content**
- Respect cultural expectations
- Avoid literal or robotic translation

---

## 5. Editorial Philosophy

### 5.1 Village-Specific, Not Generic

Example (important):

- Vernazza content must **not** feel like:
  > “Riomaggiore with different names”

Instead, it should:
- Emphasize Vernazza’s harbor, viewpoints, social density, and atmosphere
- Shift focus where appropriate (e.g. photography spots, piazza life, boat access)
- Downplay irrelevant Riomaggiore-centric themes

Each village page answers:
> “What makes *this* village different from the others?”

---

### 5.2 Language as Cultural Adaptation

Language versions are **not translations**.

Agents must:
- Rewrite content natively per language
- Adjust tone and rhythm
- Adapt metaphors, expressions, and emphasis

Example:
- German content may be more structured and informational
- Italian content may feel more narrative and local
- English content may balance inspiration and clarity

---

## 6. Agent-Based Content Creation

### 6.1 Role of Agents

Content is created by **autonomous editorial agents**, not by humans.

Agents act as:
- Local travel editors
- Cultural interpreters
- Subject-matter writers
- Long-term maintainers of content quality

Each agent:
- Has a defined persona
- Has a distinct writing style
- Produces consistent output over time

---

### 6.2 Technology Foundation

- Claude Agent SDK is already integrated
- Agent personas are already defined
- Tooling is already configured:
  - Web Search Tool
  - Web Fetch Tool

This phase **assumes**:
- Agents can research live web data
- Agents can fetch authoritative sources
- Agents can reason and synthesize information autonomously

No tooling setup is part of this task.

---

## 7. Content Generation Strategy

### 7.1 Riomaggiore as Structural Blueprint

For each page type (e.g. Restaurants, Things to Do, Events):

- Use the Riomaggiore English page as:
  - A content outline
  - A depth reference
  - A stylistic baseline

Agents must:
- Preserve section intent
- Match editorial richness
- Replace all content with village-specific knowledge

---

### 7.2 Per-Village Content Workflow

For each village, agents should:

1. Analyze the Riomaggiore reference page
2. Identify:
   - Section purpose
   - Expected content depth
   - Tone and pacing
3. Research the target village using:
   - Web search
   - Web fetch
4. Generate **new original content**:
   - Specific to that village
   - Factually accurate
   - Editorially engaging

---

### 7.3 Per-Language Adaptation Workflow

For each language version, agents should:

1. Start from the village-specific master content
2. Re-author the text in the target language
3. Adapt:
   - Sentence structure
   - Cultural framing
   - Idiomatic expressions
4. Avoid:
   - Literal translations
   - Sentence-by-sentence mapping

---

## 8. Editorial Consistency Rules

Across all villages and languages:

- Content length should be comparable
- Section coverage must be complete
- Tone must match the agent’s persona
- No placeholders or generic phrasing
- No references to other villages unless editorially justified

---

## 9. What This Phase Does *Not* Include

This task explicitly does **not** include:

- Layout changes
- Component changes
- Navigation changes
- Design tweaks
- SEO optimization (can be layered later)
- Manual editorial review (unless explicitly added later)

---

## 10. Definition of Done

This phase is complete when:

- Every village has full content for all pages
- Every page exists in all supported languages
- No page contains Riomaggiore-specific content unless it is Riomaggiore
- Language versions read as native editorial content
- All content is authored by agents
- Layout and structure remain untouched

---

## 11. Strategic Importance

This phase is critical because:

- It validates the **agentic editorial model**
- It transforms the site from a prototype into a real publication
- It enables future scalability:
  - New villages
  - New languages
  - New content types
- It removes human bottlenecks from content production

---

## 12. Final Note

This is the moment where the application proves its core promise:

> **A fully autonomous, editorially rich, multi-language travel platform —  
maintained by agents, not humans.**

If this phase is done correctly, future growth becomes a matter of:
- Adding agents
- Defining topics
- Letting the system evolve itself
