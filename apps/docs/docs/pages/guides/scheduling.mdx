## Customizing Schedule Timing

### Cron Expression Format

Schedules use standard cron expressions:

```
┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
│ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
│ │ ┌───────────── day of month (1 - 31)
│ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
│ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday = 0)
│ │ │ │ │
│ │ │ │ │
* * * * *
```

### Common Examples

| Expression | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `0 6 * * *` | Every day at 6:00 AM |
| `0 8 * * 1` | Every Monday at 8:00 AM |
| `0 9 1 * *` | 1st of every month at 9:00 AM |
| `0 */4 * * *` | Every 4 hours |
| `30 7 * * 1-5` | Weekdays at 7:30 AM |

### Edit Cron Expression

1. Click **⚙ Edit** on the schedule
2. Enter new cron expression
3. Preview shows next 5 run times
4. Click **"Save"**

## Understanding Results

### Successful Execution

A successful execution includes:
```json
{
  "status": "completed",
  "itemsProcessed": 15,
  "issuesFound": 0,
  "duration": "2m 34s"
}
```

### Failed Execution

A failed execution includes:
```json
{
  "status": "failed",

## Schedule Types in Detail

### Scheduled Content

**What it does:**
- Finds content with `scheduled_for` date matching today
- Transitions content from "scheduled" to "published"
- Triggers site rebuild if needed

**When to adjust:**
- Change to earlier if you want content live before work hours
- Change to later for different timezone audience

### Media Check

**What it does:**
- Scans all pages for image references
- Validates each image URL is accessible
- Checks image dimensions and formats
- Reports broken or slow-loading images

**When to adjust:**
- Run more frequently for image-heavy sites
- Run after business hours to avoid load impact

### Link Validation

**What it does:**
- Crawls all internal links
- Checks external links (HTTP HEAD requests)
- Identifies broken links and orphan pages
- Creates tasks for fixes

**When to adjust:**
- Weekly is usually sufficient
- Run more often during major content changes

### Stale Content

**What it does:**
- Calculates freshness scores for all content
- Identifies content below threshold (default 70%)
- Creates editorial tasks for updates
- Notifies editors of high-priority items

**When to adjust:**
- Monthly works for most sites
- Run quarterly for stable content
- Run weekly for rapidly changing topics

## Troubleshooting

### Schedule Not Running

1. Check if schedule is enabled (not paused)
2. Verify Temporal server is running
3. Check cron expression is valid
4. Look for errors in execution history

### Execution Failing

1. Check error message in execution details
2. Verify agents have required permissions
3. Check external service connectivity
4. Review workflow logs in Temporal UI

### Missing Executions

1. Check if schedule was paused during that time
2. Verify Temporal was running
3. Check database for execution records
4. Review Temporal UI for schedule status

## Best Practices

### Timing Recommendations

- **Stagger schedules** - Don't run all at same time
- **Off-peak hours** - Run intensive tasks when traffic is low
- **Timezone awareness** - Consider your audience location

### Monitoring

- **Review history weekly** - Catch issues early
- **Set up alerts** - For consecutive failures
- **Track duration trends** - Identify performance issues

### Maintenance

- **Pause during updates** - Avoid conflicts with deployments
- **Test changes** - Use manual trigger before changing cron
- **Document custom timings** - Note why you changed defaults
